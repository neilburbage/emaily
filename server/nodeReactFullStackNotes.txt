Adding dependencies to package.json

Hi Alfred,

Just a quick question, how do I add passport to the package.json dependencies file?
I was unable to locate information on which version of passport I am using that has 
to be entered when adding it manually.
I found the answer somewhere!

Hi Neil, 

It looks like you have removed the configs folder. It is needed to run your application.

Regarding Passport, npm install passport will install the right version for your Node.js installation 
and update the package.json file automatically. Adding a package manually is not advised unless you are sure 
that it is compatible with your setup. Doing so only requires adding an entry inside the dependencies object 
inside package.json. The entry consists of: “name-of-the-module”: “version”
